### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Solomon Obwot, I recently worked on [Choose your own fake news](http://chooseyourownfakenews.com/), a platform about the impacts of fake news and the world of disinformation &  misinformation through the choices you make.

Together with David Okwii, I'm a co-host of a podcast called [The Dignited Show](https://anchor.fm/dignited-show/), a show where we talk about consumer tech in Africa and all the cool gadgets.

I'm yet to write a book, talk at events and build cool things with anyone interested. I'm a call away for the next available web development gig.
